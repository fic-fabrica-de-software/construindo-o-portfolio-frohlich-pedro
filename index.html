            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Pedro Fr√∂hlich, developer, emoticons lover, and yes, the Terry Davis quotation was
                meant to justify
                the simplicity of this website, and also, beauty is found in many other things, open your mind for us
                low level programmers, we find design and graphics difficult. :(</p>
            <p>Going for low level development, mainly with C, sometimes assembly >:)</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you want to take a look, here is my github: <h3><a href="https://github.com/frohlich-pedro">Click Me!</a></h3></p>

            <h2>Some Projects:</h2>
            <h3>My Own x86_64 OS:</h3>
            <p>named after my dead cat, AuroraOS is a simple x86_64 OS, everything is made from scratch, from the bootloader to the shell. :)</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Pong in SDL-2:</h3>
            <p>I've made a pong clone, nothing so different until you see that it SUPPORTS CONTROLERS (i've only tested with xbox, but you can try with others if i'm not mistaken) :3</p>
            <br>
            <h3>x86_64 Calculator:</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you just get bored, then you start learning assembly (x86_64), and then a little flame sparkles: "I can make a calculator!", and then BOOM, x86_64 assembly calculator</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Quick Reminder:</h3>
            <p>All of these are in my github, so if you want to see and test them, just go there and take a look, the link is at the top of this humble portfolio. :)</p>
